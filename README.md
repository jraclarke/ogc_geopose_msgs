# OGC GeoPose - ROS/ROS2 Integration

Defining ROS msg definitions for OGC GeoPose 1.0

GeoPose 1.0 is an OGC Implementation Standard for exchanging the location and orientation of real or virtual geometric objects (“Poses”) within reference frames anchored to the earth’s surface (“Geo”) or within other astronomical coordinate systems.

The standard specifies two Basic forms with no configuration options for common use cases, an Advanced form with more flexibility for more complex applications, and five composite GeoPose structures that support time series plus chain and graph structures.

These eight Standardization Targets are independent. There are no dependencies between Targets and each may be implemented as needed to support a specific use case.
